        <h3>Career Objective</h3>
        As a final year student in a Federal University, I aspire to broaden my
        horizon by taking on different new and potentially challenging roles.
        This serves to enhance my buoyancy while navigating the huddles of
        corporate Nigeria. I am an industrious and goal-driven individual with a
        knack for knowledge and experience.

        <h3>Hobbies and Interests</h3>
        I am a very sporty individual, and I enjoy working out, this is because
        I strongly believe that exercise is the key to healthy living. In my
        spare time, I also enjoy computing and socialising with my friends and
        family.

          <summary>The Journey So Far</summary>
          I've always had a flare for technology; however, my interest in Web
          Development was heightened when I was invited by a close friend,
          <a

            ><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i>Soneye Juwon Caleb</a
          >, to join a group of young beginners in the field. This gave me the
          push I very much needed which led me to enroll in a number of Web
          Development courses.<br />
          As I strive to perfect my skills, I can only say, I look forward to
          seeing what the future holds.ðŸ˜‰
